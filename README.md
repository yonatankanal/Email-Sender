Directions to write and download emails: 

1. Hit the green "Code" button, navigate to "Codespaces", and hit the "+" to create a codespace (the virutal environment where the code will run). If that doesn't work, click on one the the existing codespaces under the "On current branch" section.
2. Once in the codespace, add your two files to the "Files" folder on the left. (If you don't see this folder, click on the icon with two pieces of paper on the way left. Then, make sure the "Email-Sender" droplist is down.)
3. Make sure the first file is named "spreadsheet_1.xlsx" and the second file is named "spreadsheet_2.xlsx". (To rename, right-click on the file and click "Rename".)
4. Now delete any files which may be in the "Emls" folder.
5. Now you need to run the program. Look at the bottom half of the screen below the code and make sure the menu alongs its top is on "Terminal".
6. You will see words that look something like this: "@yonatankanal âžœ /workspaces/Email-Sender (main) $". In front of the dollar sign type the command "python Send_emails.py" (case sensitive, double check spelling) and hit enter.
7. Choose the email format, type the number of the format in, and hit enter.
8. Your email files are now in the "Emls" folder on the left. Download them by right-clicking and hitting download.
9. Go to the file and open it in outlook (choose the "Drafts" folder if it gives you the option).
10. You will now be able to find the email in your "Drafts" folder in Outlook. Once you're in the email you will have to choose to "Edit" the email. You may have to click on the three dots in the menu bar to find this option.
11. Finally, once you put in the recipient's email address and change the subject you can send the email as normal!
